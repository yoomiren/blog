To this day, I have finished coding the entire website. I don't mean this website is finished, it still needs some adjustments. However, all information has been put in and linked together. 

After the first version class presentation, I have realized that on my homepage, the four images which each has a title, should each be linking to another page with information. During the user testing, almost everyone tried to click on the image (since there is a title on each of them) and then found out that they are not linked. Also, since my homepage is very simple, there is not much actual information about the brand and what does this website do.

I created four html pages, with the same layout, each of them tells the user the according information from the title.
