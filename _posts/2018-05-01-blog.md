title: May 1, 2018 | Last Week

This is the last week of working on the project before our final critique next week. I don't feel any confidence on presenting. My classmates' projects are all very strong. I finished my project, but it still feels like unfinished. I have tried my best to meet the basic requirment of the project, but things I tried in order to make the website looks better, were not working. 

I am trying to put in more different interactive things into the website, for example, I am using the code I created in Lab class to use at the "survey" page of the website, so as to make it more interative and fun.

As shown in the screenshot, once you click on an option, there is a message immediately appears at the bottom, then you can click to the next question. I want the survey to not only be a survey, but more like a little educational interaction. 

I think this is working better than the old version of the survey, which the users would keep clicing until the end of the survey, that links to the prodcut page. 

On Thursday, I want to try something different on the "contact page", to make more pages as interactive and fun as possible.
