title: April 10, 2018 | Survey
---

During the weekend, I worked on the "survey" session of the website. I browsed through the internet to see how other people uses html and css to build a survey. Most of them require complex javascript, since normally there will be a result or answer generated from the survey you take, this part is the most difficult part. The reason for my website to have a survey is because the brand is about "customize pet food that suits only for your pet". Therefore, the survey interacts with customers and convey the idea of the brand better.

I decided to code a simple and easy-to-use survey myself. I use multiple html pages that are linked together, like a multiple choice game. When you click on an option from the first page, it links you to the second page, then in the end, no matter which option you click, all of them bring you to the product page.

On top of the product page, is a random recommendated products for you. Then if you scroll down, there are other products from the brand. 

I have finished building the survey part and linked the end of it with the product page. The next step is to build the product page with two session "recommendated for you" and "all products".

I coded the homepage of my brand, it still needs some work on composition and layout. I also coded a basic layout for my product page. I need to put in photos of the products and description of them next. The hardest part is to generate the layout, with css and basic animation. Once I have the layout, I just need to replace the image holder with real images and texts.
