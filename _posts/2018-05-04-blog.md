I want to try to change my "contact page" to make it more fun, rather than asking user to fill in the blanks. When you enter your name, then you tap "enter", it leads you to the next question and then repeat the same action until the end, with a "sign up" button. You click the "sign up" button and a message "Thank you" will show. The answer you enter for each question will remain at the top of the container. 

Another option to use this part of new code is to link it at the end of my old survey, and keep the old version of contact page. Once the users finish my survey and it links to this page, for users/customers to leave their information. As this pet food brand's core idea is customizing for every one, it makes sense for users to fiirst tell us about them by taking the survey, then introduce them to us by leaving basic information. So this code can insert between the survey and the link to the product page.

I added in Mouseflow into every html pages I want to track. MY KPI goals are: what percentage of users will take the survey on my website? And how long do people stay on my product page?
