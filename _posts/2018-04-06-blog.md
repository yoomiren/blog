After deciding on the direction of my project, I started coding. The way that works easier for me is to code each piece/page separately and then link them together in the end. "Moooi" is a customizing fresh pet food company that delivers natural and delicious pet food to pet owners. Our mission is to have our pets have meals like humans do. There is no can food, no perservatives, no paste that is muddled together and you can't even recognize the ingredients. 

Since we are a delivery-only company and as a pet owner, you can customize food that is only suit for your pet's need. For example, my cat is hyperallergic, therefore she can only eats rabbit meat. We believe every pet deserves fresh food that provides them energy and health.

 The most important part of the project is the survey. Once you open the homepage, the first thing you would see is a "survey" button which leads you to the survey page. Once you finish the multiple choice survey, then it links to our product page, which on the top of the product page, is our "recommendation for your pet" and follow up with the rest of our products. 

 I have coded a homepage, with the first page of my survey. By next Tuesday, I need to finish the "product page" and "about us" page. I am still trying figure out a simple and easy way to do the "survey" and how the "survey" relates to the "recommendation" part that is generated based on the survey, for some parts.
