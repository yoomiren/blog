From last time, I have changed my homepage's design completely. I made a new html+css page that links together all my other pages, including "survey", "contact", "product". I felt that my old homepage was getting worse every time I try to change the design of it, the most important weakness of it, was that for people who first see the page, they have no idea what does this compnay do, and where to click. 

My intention for the users is to make them notice the "survey" button as soon as they open the page. Therefore, I decided to put this part at the middle of the page, in a clear and significant position.

I didn't change the "survey" htmls. So when you finish the survey, in the end, it links to the "product" page. I intentionally don't put a "homepage" buttom on the survey page because I want everyone to get to the end of the survey without quitting. For my "product" page, which is the html page that has the most information and the most layout design to do. Moreoever, since this is my concept for a brand, I have to do all the product design and packaging mockup. The product design part has taken a lot of time in this project. I have to photoshop every single product and then place them into my website.

Right now I am still working on the product page, to fill all the squares and put in product descriptions. I still need to make up a couple packaging design before I can place them into the squares. I am still thinking about putting a "recommendation" session at the top of this page, but I am not sure at this moment.

For all my buttoms on my page, I have changed the design of them a couple of times, right now they look like this:
